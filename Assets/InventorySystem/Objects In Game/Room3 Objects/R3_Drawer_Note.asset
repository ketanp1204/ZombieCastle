  noteText: "King Arthur was a master of the Eternal Fire. He had trained his entire
    army in the ways of battle using the sacred fire. In the war with the Bronad
    kingdom, they burned all their enemies to death and won the war. No other kingdom
    has ever dared to face King Arthur and his army since then. Only by obtaining
    the Eternal Fire can one have some hope of standing against him.\r"
